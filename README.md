## Overview

## Built with

- react

## What I learned

I did this after putting down React for a while.  I originally completed this tutorial before the introduction of hooks so this time I did it with hooks. 

## Extras

- [ ] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- [x] Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- [ ] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- [x] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
